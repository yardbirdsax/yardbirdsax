### About Me

![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=yardbirdsax.yardbirdsax)

My name is Josh Feierman, and I'm a software engineer who enjoys working with cloud infrastructure, automation, and writing Golang. Currently I work as a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Max / Warner Brothers Discovery, working on cloud infrastructure engineering.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - How to be a better Go programmer (I code mainly for tool building and automation)
  - How to use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), especially in the context of infrastructure build pipelines
- âš¡ Fun facts:
  -  Outside of work, I enjoy writing, reading, hiking, and gardening. (I actually need to find more hobbies that don't involve computers.)
  -  My favorite mixed drink is the [Beacon Mule](https://nerdswithknives.com/beacon-mule-bourbon-ginger-beer-cocktail/) (though I enjoy pretty much anything with bourbon in it).
  -  I have ADHD.
